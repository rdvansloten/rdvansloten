### Hi, I'm Rudy 👋

I'm a cloud architect / platform engineer, specialized in [Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/Azure), Kubernetes and infrastructure automation. I hold [several certifications](https://www.credly.com/users/rdvansloten/badges) for Microsoft Azure, DevOps and other cloud native tools.

In my free time, I enjoy 🤖 building Gunpla, 🎮 playing / developing video games and 🐶 hanging out with my pet Corgi.
